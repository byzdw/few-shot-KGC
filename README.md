# Few-shot KGC with Adaptive Negative Sampling Mechanism
This is the implementation for “Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion with Adaptive Negative Sampling Mechanism“.

Few-shot knowledge graph completion (few-shot KGC) mines unseen knowledge by leveraging meta-learning and contrastive learning to achieve accurate predictions with limited triples.
In this paper, we introduce curriculum learning into few-shot KGC and propose a novel few-shot KGC framework empowered by an adaptive negative sampling mechanism, which can eliminate the dependence on any additional manual experience, reduce mislabeling, and generate negative queries with appropriate difficulty.
